    summary: 'The certified "Freshman Maze" with its own laws of physics 🌀',
    description: `
      Welcome to Dwinelle Hall, the largest "Escape Room" on campus and the starting point of every freshman's nightmares.
      
      This building is actually two completely different structures (the "Office Wing" and the "Academic Wing") forcibly stitched together, resulting in its infamous split-level design. You will often find yourself pressing "Level F" on the elevator only to walk out onto a mezzanine, or walking down a hall where the floor color changes and suddenly Level 2 becomes Level B1.

      The laws of physics don't apply here. If you don't bring a compass (or the navigator app listed below), you might actually get lost on your way to a GSI's office and never be seen again.

      🚧 **Live Status (2025)**: Heads up! The Dwinelle Parking Lot on the west side is gone. It is now the construction site for the **Undergraduate Academic Building**, scheduled for completion in 2026. This means some side entrances may be blocked, and you can expect construction noise nearby.
    `,
    funFacts: [
      'It has the most confusing room numbering system on campus (100s are on Level D, 200s on Level E... logic? We don\'t do that here).',
      'Rumor has it the architects of the office wing and classroom wing refused to talk to each other, so the construction crew just forced the blueprints together (it\'s a myth, but walk around inside and you\'ll believe it).',
      'It is the second-largest building on campus, surpassed only by VLSB, which means the area in which you can get lost is massive.'

    studentTips: [
      '🚧 **Construction Alert**: The West entrance is tricky right now due to the new building construction. Follow the detour signs.',
      '🗺️ **Life Saver**: Don\'t try to wing it! Use the [Dwinelle 3D Navigator](https://dkess.me/dwinelle/). It was built by a former CS student and works way better than Google Maps inside.',

  description: `
      This building isn't just the Physics Department HQ; it's a holy site for modern physics. The early meetings of the famous Manhattan Project happened right here—secretly convened by J. Robert Oppenheimer in his top-floor corner office.

      Formerly known as "LeConte Hall," it is a classic Beaux-Arts structure. Today's Physics Building complex includes both North and South halls. It has witnessed the birth of countless Nobel Prizes, including where Ernest Lawrence built the world's first cyclotron ("Atom Smasher"). While the history is heavy, the classroom facilities can feel a bit "vintage," but maybe taking classes here will help you absorb some genius IQ... or at least some good luck?

  summary: 'A modern architectural gem on the Glade, housing a million volumes of East Asian treasures 📚',
  description: `
    The C.V. Starr East Asian Library (EAL) is one of the most modern and elegant buildings on campus, sitting prominently across from Doe Library on Memorial Glade. It stands not just as a library, but as a bridge connecting Eastern and Western cultures.

    The design masterfully blends traditional Asian elements with modern aesthetics. The massive bronze screens on the exterior are not only visually striking but also regulate sunlight. Inside, a central skylight floods the space with natural light—a stark and welcome contrast to the "dungeon" vibes of some older campus buildings.

    Housing over one million volumes in Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, it is one of the largest East Asian research collections in the Western world. For students, the reading rooms offer a quiet, comfortable sanctuary, far removed from the chaos of Moffitt, making it the perfect spot for deep focus.
  `,
  funFacts: [
    '📚 **One in a Million**: It was the first freestanding library building at a U.S. university dedicated exclusively to an East Asian collection.',
    '🧩 **Bronze Screens**: The distinctive bronze grilles on the exterior were cast in Hangzhou, China. The pattern combines a traditional "cracked ice" motif with a modern grid, symbolizing the fusion of old and new.',
    '🤫 **Pin-Drop Quiet**: Compared to the buzz of Moffitt or the grandeur of Doe, EAL has one of the quietest atmospheres on campus. You can practically hear a page turn.',
    '💡 **Let There Be Light**: A massive central skylight cuts through the building, allowing natural light to penetrate all the way to the lowest level, so you never feel like you\'re studying in a basement.'
  ],
  studentTips: [
    '⚠️ **Important Update: The library is currently CLOSED for construction (latest updates suggest reopening in 2025, check official site).**',
    '🛋️ **Prime Real Estate**: The 2nd-floor reading room has massive windows facing Memorial Glade. It\'s the best spot for scenic studying (or people-watching on the Glade).',
    '🤫 **Serious Study Only**: The vibe here is intense. If you need to chat for a group project, **do not come here**. You will get glared at.',
    '🚻 **Restroom Tier List**: S-Tier. The restrooms here are widely considered some of the cleanest and most modern on campus, likely because the building is relatively new.'
