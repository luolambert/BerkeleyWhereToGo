    description: `
      Welcome to Dwinelle Hall, the largest "Escape Room" on campus.
      
      This building is actually two completely different structures (the southern "Office Wing" and the northern "Academic Wing") forcibly stitched together, resulting in its infamous split-level design. You will often find yourself pressing "Level F" on the elevator only to walk out onto a mezzanine, or walking down a hall where the floor color changes and suddenly Level 2 becomes Level B1.

      🚧 **Live Status (2025)**: Heads up! The Dwinelle Parking Lot on the west side is gone. It is now the construction site for the **Undergraduate Academic Building**, scheduled for completion in 2026. This means some side entrances may be blocked, and you can expect construction noise nearby.
    `,
    funFacts: [
      'It has the most confusing room numbering system on campus (100s are on Level D, 200s on Level E... don\'t ask why).',
      'Rumor has it the architects of the office wing and classroom wing refused to talk to each other, so the construction crew just forced the blueprints together (it\'s a myth, but a believable one).',
      'It is the second-largest building on campus, surpassed only by VLSB.'
    ],
    studentTips: [
      '🚧 **Construction Alert**: The West entrance is tricky right now due to the new building construction. Follow the detour signs.',
      '🗺️ **Life Saver**: Don\'t try to wing it! Use the [Dwinelle 3D Navigator](https://dkess.me/dwinelle/). It was built by a former CS student and works way better than Google Maps inside.',
      '🚽 **Restroom Hack**: The restrooms on Level E (Classroom side) are renovated and decent. Avoid the basement (Level A/B) restrooms at all costs—they have zero cell service and serious "horror movie" vibes.',
      '🌟 **Secret Spot**: Find "Ishi Court." It\'s an open-air courtyard wrapped inside the center of Dwinelle. It\'s quiet, hidden, and perfect for reading.',
      '🧭 **Navigation Tip**: If the floor material suddenly changes (e.g., from terrazzo to linoleum), congratulations, you just crossed the border between the Office and Academic wings.'
