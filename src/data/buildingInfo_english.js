      Welcome to Dwinelle Hall, the largest "Escape Room" on campus.
      
      This building is actually two completely different structures (the southern "Office Wing" and the northern "Academic Wing") forcibly stitched together, resulting in its infamous split-level design. You will often find yourself pressing "Level F" on the elevator only to walk out onto a mezzanine, or walking down a hall where the floor color changes and suddenly Level 2 becomes Level B1.

      🚧 **Live Status (2025)**: Heads up! The Dwinelle Parking Lot on the west side is gone. It is now the construction site for the **Undergraduate Academic Building**, scheduled for completion in 2026. This means some side entrances may be blocked, and you can expect construction noise nearby.

  description: `
    Step into the Haas School of Business, and you might feel like you've left the rest of UC Berkeley behind. This "mini-campus" consists of interconnected buildings surrounding a pristine central courtyard, designed to foster community (and networking, of course).

    Designed by renowned architect Charles Moore, Haas is a blend of modern facilities and collaborative spaces. It houses state-of-the-art classrooms, the Long Business Library, and an atmosphere that buzzes with entrepreneurial energy. It's the place where future CEOs are made, and where everyone seems to own a blazer.

  studentTips: [
    '🚽 **Throne Room:** Hands down, Haas has the best restrooms on campus. They are clean, modern, and often have full-length mirrors. Worth the walk.',

    '☕ **Cafe Culture:** The on-site cafe is a great spot to grab a bite, but be prepared for prices that reflect the future salaries of the students.',
    '🐍 **Stereotype Alert:** You might hear jokes about "Haas-holes" or "snakes" due to the competitive grading curve, but many students find the community genuinely supportive.'

    Latimer Hall is the central hub of the College of Chemistry. Built in the 1960s, it's known for its complex layout and connections to surrounding buildings. It serves as the main administrative and research center for the department and is the gateway to the famous rotating lecture hall, Pimentel Hall.

    While it may look like a standard modernist box from the outside, its significance is immense. The halls have been walked by numerous Nobel Laureates, and the air is often filled with the faint (and sometimes strong) scent of chemical breakthroughs.

    Located on the south side of campus, this building was known as Barrows Hall until 2020, when it was unnamed due to the namesake's racist history. It is now temporarily referred to as "The Social Sciences Building."

    Home to the College of Environmental Design (CED), Bauer Wurster Hall is a polarizing masterpiece of Brutalist architecture. With its raw concrete facade and massive sunshades, it often competes with Evans Hall for the title of "Campus's Ugliest Building."

    However, the design is intentional. It was built to be a "rough" building that students could learn from—pipes, ducts, and structural elements are left exposed as a teaching tool.
