      Welcome to Dwinelle Hall, the largest "Escape Room" on campus.
      
      This building is actually two completely different structures (the southern "Office Wing" and the northern "Academic Wing") forcibly stitched together, resulting in its infamous split-level design. You will often find yourself pressing "Level F" on the elevator only to walk out onto a mezzanine, or walking down a hall where the floor color changes and suddenly Level 2 becomes Level B1.

      🚧 **Live Status (2025)**: Heads up! The Dwinelle Parking Lot on the west side is gone. It is now the construction site for the **Undergraduate Academic Building**, scheduled for completion in 2026. This means some side entrances may be blocked, and you can expect construction noise nearby.

  summary: 'The "Bunker" got a glow-up. Now merging Engineering & Math, it\'s cleaner but the stress levels remain the same. 🚧✨',
  description: `
    Formerly known as the "Bechtel Engineering Center" (or affectionately, "The Bunker"), this place just underwent a massive glow-up and reopened in June 2025 as the **Grimes Engineering Center**.
    
    It has now absorbed the Mathematics Statistics Library from Evans Hall, evolving into the **Kresge Engineering & Mathematical Sciences Library**. While the architects added skylights and glass pavilions to bring in natural light, don't be fooled—the air is still thick with the tension of debugging code and solving differential equations.

  funFacts: [
    '🏗️ **From Bunker to Glass**: Historically known as a windowless concrete bunker. The 2025 renovation added two new airy floors, so you can finally see the sun while your code fails to compile.',
    '📚 **The Merger**: It officially swallowed the Math Stats Library from Evans Hall. Double the books, double the academic pressure.',
    '❄️ **Climate Control**: The AC upgrade is real. It’s one of the best places to escape the heat, though bring a hoodie because it can get chilly.'
